            "text/markdown": "Okay, I've reviewed the code and here's my feedback.\n\n**1. Feedback:**\n\n*   **Logic Errors:**  The code aims to filter a list of numbers, remove duplicates, keep only numbers greater than or equal to 30, sort the remaining numbers, and return them in descending order. The logic is sound overall, but there's room for improvement in efficiency and clarity.\n*   **Code Readability and Naming Conventions:**\n    *   Variable names are generally okay (`list_of_nums`, `temp_list`, `new_list`), but could be more descriptive to improve readability. For example, `unique_numbers` instead of `temp_list` would be clearer.\n    *   The code is somewhat verbose.  It could be more concise by using list comprehensions and built-in functions.\n    *   There are no comments explaining the purpose of each section of the code.\n*   **Code Efficiency and Best Practices:**\n    *   Using `n not in temp_list` inside a loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `temp_list`.  This makes the duplicate removal process inefficient, especially for large lists.  Using a `set` is a much more efficient way to remove duplicates (O(1) average case for checking membership).\n    *   Creating multiple lists (`temp_list`, `new_list`) can be avoided by using list comprehensions or generator expressions, making the code more memory-efficient.\n    *   Sorting and reversing can be done in a single step using the `sort` method with the `reverse` parameter.\n\n**2. Corrected Version of the Code:**\n\n```python\ndef process_numbers(numbers):\n  \"\"\"\n  Filters a list of numbers, removing duplicates, keeping only numbers >= 30,\n  and returns the remaining numbers in descending order.\n\n  Args:\n    numbers: A list of numbers.\n\n  Returns:\n    A list of numbers that are >= 30, unique, and sorted in descending order.\n  \"\"\"\n  unique_numbers = set(numbers)  # Remove duplicates efficiently\n  filtered_numbers = [num for num in unique_numbers if num >= 30]  # Filter numbers >= 30\n  filtered_numbers.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order\n  return filtered_numbers\n```\n\n**3. Explanation of Changes:**\n\n*   **Function Name:** Changed `process_nums` to `process_numbers` for better readability.\n*   **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain what the function does, its arguments, and its return value.  This is crucial for maintainability.\n*   **Duplicate Removal:** Replaced the loop and `temp_list` with `unique_numbers = set(numbers)`.  This leverages the properties of a `set` to efficiently remove duplicates in O(n) time complexity on average, compared to the original code's O(n^2) complexity in the worst case.\n*   **Filtering:** Replaced the `while` loop and `new_list` with a list comprehension: `filtered_numbers = [num for num in unique_numbers if num >= 30]`. This combines the filtering step into a single, more readable line.\n*   **Sorting:** Combined the sorting and reversing steps into a single line: `filtered_numbers.sort(reverse=True)`.  This is more concise and efficient.\n*   **Variable Names:** Changed `temp_list` to `unique_numbers` and `new_list` to `filtered_numbers` for increased clarity.\n\n**Why these changes improve the original code:**\n\n*   **Efficiency:** Using a `set` for duplicate removal significantly improves performance, especially for large lists.\n*   **Readability:**  List comprehensions and more descriptive variable names make the code easier to understand.\n*   **Conciseness:** Reducing the number of lines of code while maintaining clarity makes the code easier to maintain and reason about.\n*   **Maintainability:** The docstring and improved structure make the code easier to understand and modify in the future.\n",
