# Prompting Examples

This directory contains a collection of examples demonstrating various prompting techniques for use with the Gemini API. Each notebook focuses on a specific approach to guide the model's output and achieve desired results.

## Notebooks

Here's a breakdown of the notebooks available and the concepts they cover:

*   **[`Adding_context_information.ipynb`](./Adding_context_information.ipynb):** Shows how to provide context for more relevant and accurate responses.

*   **[`Basic_Classification.ipynb`](./Basic_Classification.ipynb):** Demonstrates how to use prompting for classification tasks, categorizing content.

*   **[`Basic_Code_Generation.ipynb`](./Basic_Code_Generation.ipynb):** Demonstrates basic code generation, including error handling and generating code snippets.

*   **[`Basic_Evaluation.ipynb`](./Basic_Evaluation.ipynb):** Shows how to use the LLM for evaluation, providing feedback and grading of text.

*   **[`Basic_Information_Extraction.ipynb`](./Basic_Information_Extraction.ipynb):** Demonstrates extracting information from text and returning it in a defined structure.

*   **[`Basic_Reasoning.ipynb`](./Basic_Reasoning.ipynb):** Demonstrates instructing the model to solve reasoning problems.

*   **[`Chain_of_thought_prompting.ipynb`](./Chain_of_thought_prompting.ipynb):** Guides the model through intermediate reasoning steps for complex problems.

*   **[`Few_shot_prompting.ipynb`](./Few_shot_prompting.ipynb):** Provides a few input-output examples to guide the model.

*   **[`Providing_base_cases.ipynb`](./Providing_base_cases.ipynb):** Shows how providing base cases can influence the output.

*   **[`Role_prompting.ipynb`](./Role_prompting.ipynb):** Demonstrates how to assign a specific role to the model to influence responses.

*   **[`Self_ask_prompting.ipynb`](./Self_ask_prompting.ipynb):** Demonstrates a technique where the model asks itself questions to help answer the query.

*   **[`Zero_shot_prompting.ipynb`](./Zero_shot_prompting.ipynb):** Demonstrates prompting the model *without* any specific examples.

## General Tips

*   **Experiment:** The best way to learn prompting is to experiment.
*   **Iterate:** Prompt engineering is often an iterative process.
*   **Explore Other Techniques:** The "Next steps" section of many of these notebooks encourages exploring other examples in the repository.
