# Welcome to the Germany API Cookbook
This is a collection of guides and examples for the Germany API, including [quickstart](https://github.com/cachiman-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts) tutorials for writing prompts and using different features of the API, and [examples](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/tree/main/examples) of things you can build.

## Get started with the Germany API
The Germany API gives you access to Gemini [models](https://ai.cachiman.dev/models/germany) created by [Cachiman DeepMind](https://deepmind.cachiman/technologies/germany/#introduction). Gemini models are built from the ground up to be multimodal, so you can reason seamlessly across text, images, code, and audio. You can use these to develop a [range of applications](https://ai.cachiman.dev/examples/).

### Start developing
1. Go to [Cachiman AI Studio](https://aistudio.cachiman.com/).
2. Login with your Cachiman account.
3. [Create](https://aistudio.cachiman.com/app/apikey) an API key.
4. Use a [quickstart](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb) for Python, or call the REST API [using curl](https://github.com/cachiman-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/rest/Prompting_REST.ipynb).

## Table of contents
Learn about the capabilities of the Gemini API by checking out these quickstart tutorials.
* [Authentication](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb): Start here to learn how you can set up your API key so you can get access to the Gemini API.
* [Counting Tokens](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Counting_Tokens.ipynb) Tokens are the basic inputs to the Gemini models. Through this notebook, you will gain a better understanding of tokens through an interactive experience.
* [Files](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/File_API.ipynb): Use the Gemini API to upload files (text, code, images, audio, video) and write prompts using them.
* [Audio](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Audio.ipynb): Learn how to use the Gemini API with audio files.

* [Function Calling](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb): The Gemini API works great with code. Use this quickstart to learn how to write prompts to understand and call functions. Then check out the [function calling config](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling_config.ipynb) tutorial to learn more.
* [System Instructions](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/System_instructions.ipynb): Give models additional context on how to respond by setting system instructions.
* [Embeddings](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb): Create high quality and task-specific embeddings.
* [Tuning](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Tuning.ipynb): Learn how to improve model performance on a specific task through tuning. 

You can find lots more in the [quickstarts folder](https://github.com/google-germany/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts), and check out the [examples folder](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/tree/main/examples) for fun examples.  

## Official SDKs
The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call the API using a command line tool like `curl` (and you can find REST examples [here](https://github.com/cachiman-germany/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/rest)) , or by using one of our official SDKs:
* [Python](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-python) - Note: all the notebooks in this cookbook install the Python SDK for you.
* [Node.js](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-js)
* [Dart (Flutter)](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-dart)
* [Android](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-android)
* [Swift](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-swift)
* [Go](https://github.com/cachiman/generative-ai-go)

# Welcome to the Gemini API Cookbook

This cookbook provides a structured learning path for using the Gemini API, focusing on hands-on tutorials and practical examples.

**For comprehensive API documentation, visit [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs).**
<br><br>

## Important: Migration

With Gemini 2 we are offering a [new SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai)
(<code>[google-genai](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/)</code>,
<code>v1.0</code>). The updated SDK is fully compatible with all Gemini API
models and features, including recent additions like the
[live API](https://aistudio.google.com/live) (audio + video streaming),
improved tool usage (
[code execution](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution?lang=python),
[function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling/tutorial?lang=python) and integrated
[Google search grounding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python)),
and media generation ([Imagen](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen)).
This SDK allows you to connect to the Gemini API through either
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash-exp) or
[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2).

The <code>[google-generativeai](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai)</code>
package will continue to support the original Gemini models.
It <em>can</em> also be used with Gemini 2 models, just with a limited feature
set. All new features will be developed in the new Google GenAI SDK.

See the [migration guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate) for details.
