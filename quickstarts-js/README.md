# JavaScript/TypeScript Quickstarts

Welcome to the JavaScript/TypeScript section of the Gemini Cookbook!

This folder contains code samples and quickstart notebooks designed to help you get up and running with Gemini models using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.

While you can explore the code samples directly here, we highly recommend opening them in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps) for the best experience. AI Studio lets you experiment with the code interactively without any setup required.

## About This Folder

This is a growing collection of fun and practical examples demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini API in JavaScript and TypeScript. We're starting with foundational examples, and more advanced and diverse use cases will be added soon, just like the existing Python examples in the [`quickstart`](../quickstarts/) and [`examples`](../examples/) folders.

Stay tuned, more JavaScript notebooks are on the way!
