            "\n",
            "Early in my career, I spent a lot of time working on visions, roadmaps, and ideas. Some of them never materialized, leading to large projects being scrapped or canceled. Even today, I encounter this, as do people on my team, and even entire companies! Priorities change, markets shift, there are countless reasons for it. But I remember feeling so frustrated, coming straight out of school with this ingrained idea that you're given an assignment, you do it, you get graded, and that's it.\n",
            "\n",
            "There was no concept of \"throwaway work\" in that academic setting. You were given a task, expected to produce, and then evaluated.  Entering the workforce, I struggled to reconcile this ingrained mentality with the reality that much of what I produced might not matter. Projects shifted, priorities changed, and things I poured time into could be discarded without a second thought. It felt like a monumental waste of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It took a while to get over it, but I didn't truly appreciate the value of this \"throwaway work\" until joining my current team. We have this culture of \"right to think,\" and it suddenly changed my perspective. It wasn't simply about accepting that priorities change and work gets abandoned; it was about understanding that the act of creation, the content generated, is part of an ongoing process of improvement. \n",
            "\n",
            "This \"right to think\" mentality fosters a space where producing work, even work that might be discarded, is about honing your skills and growing. It encourages writing more, writing earlier, writing often, and writing without the pressure of creating a final product. It encourages experimentation, exploration, and iteration, knowing that the value lies in the process itself, not just the end result. \n",
            "\n",
            "This approach ties in nicely with iterative processes, \"doing by learning\", and embracing a mindset of continuous improvement. It's about reframing the idea of \"throwaway work\"  – there is no such thing in this model. Everything you produce contributes to your development, helping you hone your skills and become better over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "I now champion this \"right to think\" concept and believe it’s something we all should embrace. Reframing our perception of work – especially for those entering the workforce – to understand that every effort, even those leading to discarded projects, is part of a continuous learning journey, is crucial. It's not about wasted time, but rather time invested in growth and self-improvement. \n",
