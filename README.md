# Welcome to the Gemini API Cookbook

This is a collection of guides and examples for the Gemini API, including [quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts) tutorials for writing prompts and using different features of the API, and [examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples) of things you can build.

## Get started with the Gemini API

The Gemini API gives you access to Gemini [models](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) created by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction). Gemini models are built from the ground up to be multimodal, so you can reason seamlessly across text, images, code, and audio. You can use these to develop a [range of applications](https://ai.google.dev/examples/).

### Start developing

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Login with your Google account.
3. [Create](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) an API key.
4. Use a [quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb) for Python, or call the REST API [using curl](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/rest/Prompting_REST.ipynb).

### Capabilities

Learn about the capabilities of the Gemini API by checking out the quickstarts for [safety](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Safety.ipynb), [embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb), [function calling](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb), [audio](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Audio.ipynb), and more.

## Official SDKs

The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call the API using a command line tool like `curl` , or by using one of our official SDKs:

- [Python](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-js)
- [Dart (Flutter)](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-dart)
- [Android](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-android)
- [Swift](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-swift)
- [Go](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-go)
