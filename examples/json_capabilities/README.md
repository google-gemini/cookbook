# Gemini JSON Capabilities

This directory provides a collection of examples demonstrating how to leverage the Gemini API's powerful JSON capabilities for various text processing tasks. Each notebook focuses on a specific application, providing practical code and explanations to help you get started.

**Here's a summary of the available notebooks:**

*   **[Entity Extraction](./Entity_Extraction_JSON.ipynb):** Learn how to extract structured data from text by identifying and classifying entities like people, companies, locations, and more. You define a custom JSON schema to specify the categories you're interested in, and the API returns the extracted entities in a structured JSON format.

*   **[Sentiment Analysis](./Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb):** Discover how to analyze the sentiment of text, such as customer reviews or social media posts, and quantify the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores. The notebook demonstrates defining a JSON schema for the sentiment scores and using the API to obtain these scores in a structured JSON response.

*   **[Text Classification](./Text_Classification.ipynb):** Explore how to categorize text into predefined topics or classes. This notebook shows you how to define a JSON schema to represent the topics and their relevance scores, enabling you to automatically classify documents, articles, or any other textual data.

*   **[Text Summarization](./Text_Summarization.ipynb):** Learn how to generate concise summaries of long texts while extracting key information such as characters, locations, and genres. You'll see how to define a comprehensive JSON schema that includes a synopsis, lists of genres, locations, and characters, and use the API to obtain a structured JSON summary of the text.

**Getting Started:**

Each notebook provides step-by-step instructions and runnable code examples. Simply follow the instructions in each notebook to experiment with different texts and schemas.

**Key Benefits of Using JSON with the Gemini API:**

*   **Structured Output:** Obtain results in a well-defined, predictable JSON format, making it easy to integrate with other applications and systems.
*   **Customizable Schemas:** Define your own JSON schemas to tailor the API's output to your specific needs and data requirements.
*   **Simplified Data Processing:** Streamline data extraction and analysis by working with structured data instead of raw text.

This cookbook is designed to help you unlock the full potential of the Gemini API's JSON capabilities and build powerful text processing solutions. Happy coding!
