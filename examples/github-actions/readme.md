# GitHub Actions and the Gemini API

This directory contains examples of using GitHub Actions to create automated workflows powered by the Gemini API.

## What is a GitHub Action?
A GitHub Action is a custom, automated task that you can run in your repository. You can use actions to automate a wide range of tasks, from running tests and building applications to creating documentation and performing content-related tasks. They are a core part of a developer's CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflow.

## How They Integrate with the Gemini API
GitHub Actions are perfect for automating AI-powered tasks. By creating a workflow that calls the Gemini API, you can:
- **Generate content:** Automatically create blog posts, documentation, or code snippets.
- **Analyze text:** Review new code, issues, or pull requests for summaries or key information.
- **Format data:** Convert unstructured data into a clean, structured format, such as the text-to-Markdown example in this directory.

Because the workflows run on GitHub's servers, they have direct access to your repository's files and can use secrets to securely handle your API keys. This creates a powerful, hands-off automation system.
