This ensures that for a unique combination of `owner` and `token_mint`, there is only one possible `Vault` PDA.\n",

              "    *   Because the `vault` PDA is derived from `owner.key()` and `token_mint.key()`, for any given `owner` (user) and `token_mint` (token type), there can be **only one deterministic `Vault` PDA address**.\n",

An additional unique seed (like a custom `vault_id` or an incrementing index) would need to be added to the `vault` PDA's seeds to differentiate them.\n",

You'd typically load the `mint_account` data and deserialize it using `spl_token_2022::state::Mint::unpack` to get the correct `decimals`.\n",
