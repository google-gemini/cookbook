            "Early in my career, I spent a lot of time working on visions, roadmaps, and ideas. Some of them ended up not happening at all, or were essentially thrown away.  It was frustrating, especially coming straight out of school with the idea that you’re given an assignment, you do it, and then you’re graded on it.  There's no \"takesies-backsies\" in school.  You get the assignment, you produce the work, and that’s that. \n",

            "\n",
            "It took me a while to get over it, but I don’t think I truly appreciated this until I joined my current team. They have a \"right to think\" culture, and that changed everything. \n",

            "The \"right to think\" culture isn’t simply about accepting that priorities change and things shift; it's about recognizing that what you produce, even if it's not the final product, is valuable.  It's about learning and iterating.\n",
            "\n",
            "This \"right to think\" idea ties in nicely with iterative processes and learning by doing.  It's a reframing of the mindset around throwaway work.  There's no such thing as throwaway work.  It's all helping you to hone your skills and get better over time. \n",
            "\n",
            "I'm constantly talking about this reframing, and I think it’s important to call out the importance of writing to think. It's about being willing to scrap things and move on once they’ve served their purpose.  Write more, write earlier, write often. Don’t worry about the final product. Just get it out there.\n",
