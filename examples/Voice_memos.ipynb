I focused on capturing your conversational tone and incorporating the key points you emphasized, as well as echoing the style of your previous writing.\n\n## Writing to Think: Why \"Throwaway Work\" is Actually Essential\n\nEarly in my career, I spent a ton of time crafting visions, roadmaps, and big ideas. Some of them ended up on the scrap heap – entire projects canceled, resources reallocated. It still happens today, both to me and my team. Priorities change, markets shift, and sometimes, you just have to pivot.\n\nI remember being incredibly frustrated by this early on. I came straight from school with this ingrained idea that you get an assignment, and you *do* it. No take-backs, no do-overs. Here’s the content we need; now produce it, and you're graded on the final result.\n\nThe workforce is WILDLY different.\n\nIt was hard to reconcile that drive to produce with the reality that *none of it might matter*. None of it might be used, none of it might go anywhere. It felt like a monumental waste of time.\n\nIt took me a while to get over it. I didn't truly appreciate it until I joined my current team, where we have this culture of \"right to think.\" All of a sudden, it clicked. It's not simply that priorities change, and that's just part of the game. The act of producing, the content you create, is part of the process of making you better at what you do *in the future*. It's honing your skills.\n\nThis shifted how I thought about things.\n\nSo how do you extend that thinking to all aspects of your work? How do you speed up that learning and growing? That's where this culture of \"write to think\" comes into play.\n\nWrite more. You might still do the same amount, but write more, write earlier, write often. Write *without* the intention of it needing to be a final product. Be willing to scrap it and move on once it’s served its purpose.\n\nThe idea of \"write to think\" ties in nicely to iterative processes and doing-by-learning. But it’s such a great framing, and something I’m constantly talking about. It calls out the importance of writing to think and reframes young Jaclyn's mindset around \"throwaway work,\" because in this model, there's no such thing.\n\nIt's all helping you hone your skills and get better over time.\n\nIn this new light, there is no such thing as throwaway work- its all helping you hone your skills and get better over time. Each attempt, each project, each canceled assignment, helps you approach the next with a higher level of refined skills.\n"
