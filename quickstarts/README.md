# Gemini API Tutorials

This folder contains guides about all the Gemini API features so that you can get to know how to use them with complete end to end code.

When you'll be confident is your Gemini capabilities, the [examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples/) folder will be an endless source of inspiration on how to mix those capabilities together.

## Table of contents

If you are new to Gemini API, you should start with those two guides:
* [Authentication](./Authentication.ipynb): Start here to learn how you can set up your API key so you can get access to the Gemini API.
* [Get Started](./Get_started.ipynb): Learn how to make your first calls to the Gemini API and get a quick overview of everything it can do.
<br/><br/>

Then learn about how to **get started** with the other models that you can use with the API:
* [Imagen](./Get_started_imagen.ipynb): Get started with our image generation model. ([REST version](./Get_started_imagen_rest.ipynb))
* [Thinking model](./Get_started_thinking.ipynb): The thinking models are, as their names implies, capable of deeper chains of thoughts than the classical models, this guide will show you how to use those thinking cpabilities to solve complex problems. 
* More to come very soon...
<br/><br/>

There are multiples way to call the models using the Gemini API, these other **get started** guides will then show you the other ways to call the model:
* [Get started with Live API](./Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb): Get started with the live API with this comprehensive overview of its capabilities
* More to come...
<br/><br/>

Finally, these guides will deep-dive into specific capabilities of the Gemini models and API:
* [Grounding](./Search_Grounding.ipynb): Learn how to use Google Search to ground your answers with external sources.
* [Spatial understanding](./Spatial_understanding.ipynb): Learn how to use Gemini's spatial understanding capabilities to detect what's in your images, and reason about them
* [Video understanding](./Video_understanding.ipynb): Learn how to use Gemini's video understanding capabilities to analyze what's in your videos
* [Get started with Live API tools](./Get_started_LiveAPI_tools.ipynb): Now you know everything about the Live API, go to the next level and learn how to use tools with it!
<br/><br/>

Those guides are using the legacy SDK and haven't been updated yet, still they are worth checking as even if the SDK is not the same, the underlying logic of the feature stays the same. They will be converted to the SDK soon:
* [Asynchronous requests](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Asynchronous_requests.ipynb): Learn how to use Python's async/await API with the Gemini SDK to parallelize calls.
* [Counting Tokens](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Counting_Tokens.ipynb) Tokens are the basic inputs to the Gemini models. Through this notebook, you will gain a better understanding of tokens through an interactive experience.
* [Gemini Flash Introduction](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Gemini_Flash_Introduction.ipynb): Get started with Gemini Flash 1.5.
* [Models](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Models.ipynb): Learn about the different models and parameters available in the Gemini API.
* [Working with files](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/File_API.ipynb): Use the Gemini API to upload files (audio, video, images, code, text) and perform actions with them through the Gemini models.
* [Audio](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Audio.ipynb): Learn how to use the Gemini API with audio files.
* [JSON mode](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb): Discover how to use JSON mode.
* [Function Calling](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb): The Gemini API works great with code. Use this quickstart to learn how to write prompts to understand and call functions. Then check out the [function calling config](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling_config.ipynb) tutorial to learn more.
* [PDF files](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/PDF_Files.ipynb). Learn how to work with PDF files, to and upload text and images.
* [System Instructions](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/System_instructions.ipynb): Give models additional context on how to respond by setting system instructions.
* [Safety](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Safety.ipynb): Configure safety settings in the Gemini API.
* [Streaming](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Streaming.ipynb): Learn how to use streaming for single interactions, and for chat.
* [Embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb): Create high quality and task-specific embeddings.
* [Tuning](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Tuning.ipynb): Learn how to improve model performance on a specific task through tuning.
* [Video](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Video.ipynb): Upload a video to the Gemini API and use it in your prompt.
