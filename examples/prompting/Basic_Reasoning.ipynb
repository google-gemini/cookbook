This is a conditional probability problem.\n\n## Solution:\n\nLet's use Bayes' Theorem to solve this:\n\n**P(Weighted | 6) = [P(6 | Weighted) * P(Weighted)] / P(6)**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **P(Weighted | 6):** The probability that the die is weighted, given that a 6 was rolled.\n* **P(6 | Weighted):** The probability of rolling a 6 given that the die is weighted (which is 1, or 100%).\n* **P(Weighted):** The prior probability of the die being weighted (which is 1/5).\n* **P(6):** The overall probability of rolling a 6 (which we need to calculate).\n\n**Calculating P(6):**\n\n* **P(6) = P(6 | Weighted) * P(Weighted) + P(6 | Fair) * P(Fair)**\n* **P(6) = (1 * 1/5) + (1/6 * 4/5)**\n* **P(6) = 1/5 + 2/15 = 1/3**\n\n**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**\n\n* **P(Weighted | 6) = (1 * 1/5) / (1/3)**\n* **P(Weighted | 6) = 3/5 = 0.6**\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. **Bayes' Theorem:**  This theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (weighted die) given that another event has occurred (rolling a 6). \n2. **Prior Probabilities:**  We know that 1 in 5 dice are weighted (P(Weighted) = 1/5), and therefore 4 in 5 are fair (P(Fair) = 4/5).\n3. **Calculating P(6):** We calculate the probability of rolling a 6 by considering the probability of rolling a 6 with a weighted die and a fair die, and weighting them by their respective probabilities.\n4. **Conditional Probability:** We use the calculated P(6) and the probabilities from step 2 to apply Bayes' Theorem and calculate the probability of the die being weighted given that a 6 was rolled.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe probability of the die being weighted, given that a 6 was rolled, is 0.6 or 60%. This means it is more likely that the person rolled a weighted die than a fair die. \n",

Provide an explanation for each step:\n\n**Step 1:** The formula for the area of a triangle is a fundamental concept in geometry. It states that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of its base and height.\n\n**Step 2:** We substitute the given values of base (b=6) and height (h=8) into the formula to obtain a specific equation for the area of this particular triangle.\n\n**Step 3:** We perform the multiplication operation according to the order of operations, simplifying the expression to a single multiplication.\n\n**Step 4:** Finally, we perform the last multiplication to arrive at the final answer, which is 24 square units. \n",
