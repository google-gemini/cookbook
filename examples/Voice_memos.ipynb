It felt like a monumental waste of time, especially coming straight out of school with the mindset that you're given an assignment and you simply *do* it, from start to finish. There are no do-overs, just a final grade that measures our ability to execute.\n",

This mindset isn't just about acknowledging that priorities change or that projects sometimes get shelved. It's about recognizing that the very act of producing content—even if it never sees the light of day—is an integral part of becoming better at what you do. It's honing your skills, refining your thinking, and learning through iteration.\n",

            "Write to think helps you to:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Uncover Hidden Assumptions:** Writing forces you to articulate your thoughts and identify any gaps or inconsistencies in your reasoning.\n",
            "*   **Explore Different Perspectives:** By writing about a topic from various angles, you can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities involved.\n",
