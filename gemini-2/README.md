# Gemini 2.0 Cookbook

**Note:** All of this folder's content has been moved to the [websockets](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts/websockets) folder of the Cookbook's [quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts).

This folder is kept in its state so that you can find where the content has been moved and will likely be deleted when the next big model realease will happen. 

-----------

This is a collection of examples and quickstarts for using the **experimental** [Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2) model.

To learn about what’s new in the 2.0 model release and the new [Google GenAI SDKs](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai), check out the [Gemini 2.0 model page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-v2). To start experimenting with the model now, head to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for prompting or to the [Multimodal Live API demo](https://aistudio.google.com/live) to try the new Live capabilities.
