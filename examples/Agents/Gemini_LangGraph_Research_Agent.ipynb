Perched on the outskirts of modern-day Cairo, this monumental necropolis, dating back to Egypt's Old Kingdom era some 4,500 years ago, comprises three towering pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. Among them, the Great Pyramid, built for Pharaoh Khufu and completed around 2560 BCE, holds a singular distinction as the only remaining marvel of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Their sheer scale and precision continue to baffle and inspire, leading generations to ponder the profound questions: how were they built, and what secrets do they still hold?\n\n### The Enduring Mystery of Construction\n\nDespite centuries of inquiry and extensive archaeological work, the precise methods employed in the construction of the Giza Pyramids remain one of the ancient world's greatest enduring mysteries. Archaeologists have unearthed clues from excavations and ancient records, providing insights into the tools and techniques likely used. King Khufu, the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, reigned between 2585 BC and 2560 BC, during which time he led the estimated 20-year construction of his colossal tomb.\n\nNumerous theories attempt to explain this feat of engineering. The most widely accepted is the **Ramp Theory**, which posits the use of massive ramp systems to move and position the enormous stone blocks, some weighing many tons. Another intriguing proposition is the **Limestone Concrete Theory**, which suggests that the ancient Egyptians might have created a form of concrete mix from limestone and clay, pouring it into wooden molds to form the blocks in situ. While archaeological research continues to shed new light on workforce organization and construction techniques, certainty remains elusive. Fringe theories, ranging from extraterrestrial involvement to other pseudoarchaeological explanations, also abound, but these lack sufficient proof and are not accepted by mainstream experts.\n\n### Purpose Beyond the Tomb\n\nBeyond their awe-inspiring appearance, the Pyramids of Giza served a profound spiritual purpose rooted deeply in ancient Egyptian religious beliefs. While fundamentally monumental tombs for pharaohs like Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, they were more than mere burial sites; they were designed to endure an eternity, safeguarding the pharaoh's journey into the afterlife and ensuring their eternal existence.\n\nThe distinct pointed shape of the pyramid itself held significant religious symbolism. Historians suggest it was crafted to resemble a \"benben,\" an ancient Egyptian term for a primordial mound of earth from which, in their cosmology, new life was believed to sprout forth. This shape thus connected the pharaoh directly to creation and renewal, acting as a celestial stairway to the heavens. These structures were central to a complex belief system that dictated nearly every aspect of their theocratic society, serving as a physical manifestation of their profound faith in deities and the intricate cosmic order.\n\n### Unveiling Hidden Secrets: Modern Discoveries\n\nEven after millennia, the Giza complex continues to yield startling discoveries, proving that its mysteries are far from exhausted. Recent advancements in scanning technology have allowed researchers to peer into the pyramids' interiors without causing damage, leading to significant revelations.\n\nThe ongoing **ScanPyramids project**, a collaboration between researchers from Cairo University and TUM, has been at the forefront of these discoveries. In the Menkaure Pyramid, the third-largest at Giza, the team successfully uncovered two hidden air-filled spaces or void spaces using radar, ultrasound, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). This finding provides the first scientific support for a long-held suspicion among archaeologists that an additional entrance might exist on the eastern side of the pyramid, bringing researchers a \"big step closer to confirming it.\"\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, the ScanPyramids project also validated the presence of a \"hidden corridor\" within the Great Pyramid (Cheops) itself. These findings underscore the intricate and potentially multi-layered internal structures of these ancient edifices. Beyond the known chambers, there have also been sensational claims of \"massive underground structures\" or even a \"mystery new city\" beneath Giza, particularly beneath the Pyramid of Khafre. While such headlines can sound like clickbait, they stem from real research exploring subterranean features. The veracity of these claims is still being assessed, but if even part of what has been suggested proves true—such as ancient geological features deliberately built over by the Egyptians—it could fundamentally rewrite history, revealing that the builders chose Giza not just for its surface location, but for what lay hidden beneath.\n\nThe Pyramids of Giza remain an unparalleled source of human fascination. Despite centuries of study and groundbreaking modern discoveries, they continue to guard many of their secrets. Each new scan, each unearthed artifact, only deepens our appreciation for the ingenuity of their builders and reinforces the enduring allure of these ancient wonders, forever inviting us to ponder the depths of human history and the mysteries that still lie beneath the sands of time."

        "    - Current : Currently, we are only able to debug using 'print()' statements. As such, debugging across several papers can be challenging.\n",
        "    - Future: The integration of LangSmith will allow for visualisation of the full execution paths, token usage on the execution graph, and to verify at what steps the loops fail effectively.\n",

        "    - Future : The intention is to ultimately have the capability to utilise many specialised HILRAs instead of one (Generalisation) HILRA to enable much broader and deeper research opportunities."
