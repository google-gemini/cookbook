# Gemini API Tutorials

## Table of contents
Learn about the capabilities of the Gemini API by checking out these quickstarts. They walk you through how to use a feature of the Gemini API with complete end to end code.
* [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb): Start here to learn how you can set up your API key so you can get access to the Gemini API.
* [Counting Tokens](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Counting_Tokens.ipynb) Tokens are the basic inputs to the Gemini models. Through this notebook, you will gain a better understanding of tokens through an interactive experience.
* [Gemini Flash Introduction](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Gemini_Flash_Introduction.ipynb): Get started with Gemini Flash 1.5.
* [Models](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Models.ipynb): Learn about the different models and parameters available in the Gemini API.
* [Working with files](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/File_API.ipynb): Use the Gemini API to upload files (audio, video, images, code, text) and perform actions with them through the Gemini models.
* [Audio](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Audio.ipynb): Learn how to use the Gemini API with audio files.
* [JSON mode](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb): Discover how to use JSON mode.
* [Function Calling](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb): The Gemini API works great with code. Use this quickstart to learn how to write prompts to understand and call functions. Then check out the [function calling config](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling_config.ipynb) tutorial to learn more.
* [PDF files](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/PDF_Files.ipynb). Learn how to work with PDF files, to and upload text and images.
* [System Instructions](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/System_instructions.ipynb): Give models additional context on how to respond by setting system instructions.
* [Safety](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Safety.ipynb): Configure safety settings in the Gemini API.
* [Streaming](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Streaming.ipynb): Learn how to use streaming for single interactions, and for chat.
* [Embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb): Create high quality and task-specific embeddings.
* [Tuning](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Tuning.ipynb): Learn how to improve model performance on a specific task through tuning.
* [Video](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Video.ipynb): Upload a video to the Gemini API and use it in your prompt.
