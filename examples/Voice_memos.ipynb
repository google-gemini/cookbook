            "Early in my career, I spent countless hours crafting visions, roadmaps, and elaborate plans. Like many, I've experienced the frustration of seeing projects scrapped, priorities shift, and entire initiatives canceled, even today with my current team. It's a common reality across industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Coming straight out of school, I had this ingrained notion that assignments were linear: you're given a task, you execute it, and you're graded on the final product. There were no \"take-backsies\" or do-overs. This rigid structure clashed dramatically with the fluid nature of the professional world.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was difficult to reconcile the idea that I could pour my energy into work that might ultimately be deemed irrelevant or simply not make the cut. It felt like a monumental waste of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It wasn't until recently, joining my newest team, that I truly began to appreciate a different perspective. This team embraces a culture of \"write to think,\" and it's fundamentally changed how I view the creative process.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s not just about priorities changing, or stopping to work on something, or that “it’s just part of the game.” No, it's about recognizing that the act of writing itself – the content you create, regardless of its ultimate fate – is integral to your growth and development. It hones your skills and makes you better at what you do in the future, especially when it comes to ideation.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "That's where the \"write to think\" philosophy comes into play. Write more. Write earlier. Write often. But write without the pressure of producing a final, polished product. Be willing to scrap it and move on once it's served its purpose.\n",
            "\n",
            "This idea ties in nicely with iterative processes and learning by doing. But it's more than just a methodology; it's a mindset shift.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm constantly talking about this now, circling back to it. It's crucial to call out the importance of writing to think and reframe that young Jaclyn's mindset around “throwaway work.” In this model, there is no such thing as throwaway work.\n",
            "\n",
