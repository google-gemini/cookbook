This particular poem is noted for its suitability for analysis, as it addresses a subject matter that the \"plain reader\" often seeks in poetry. It also appears in Mr. Louis Untermeyer's \"Anthology of Modern American Poetry\" alongside poets who are more willing to cater to the plain reader's intelligence level.\n",
            "\n",
            "The text further suggests that Cummings writes according to a carefully constructed poetic system, but he refrains from providing a critical key to his poems, except as a \"semi-prefatorial confidence.\" This implies that as poems become more independent, the need or sense for a technical guide diminishes. The increasing difficulty of poems would not necessarily hinder understanding but rather make the reader less separated from poetry by technique.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regarding his use of punctuation, the text describes punctuation marks in Cummings' poetry as \"bolts and axels\" that make the poem a \"methodic and fool-proof piece of machinery\" that requires common sense rather than imagination for its operation. The strong reaction against his typography highlights the difficulty in engaging a reader's common sense as much as their imagination.\n",

            "text/markdown": "The text discusses E.E. Cummings as a significant poet whose work demands a \"more vigorous imaginative effort\" from the reader than what is typically applied to poetry. **His innovations are considered to have a real place in the normal course of poetry-writing, and his acceptance is suggested, if not for his own sake, then for his potential effect on the future reading of poetry of any age or style**<sup>0</sup>.\n\nOne of Cummings' earlier and simpler poems is chosen for analysis in the text, despite its potential to elicit hostility similar to his later work. This particular poem is noted for its suitability for analysis, as it addresses a subject matter that the \"plain reader\" often seeks in poetry. It also appears in Mr. **Louis Untermeyer's \"Anthology of Modern American Poetry\" alongside poets who are more willing to cater to the plain reader's intelligence level**<sup>0, 1</sup>.\n\nThe text further suggests that Cummings writes according to a carefully constructed poetic system, but he refrains from providing a critical key to his poems, except as a \"semi-prefatorial confidence.\" This implies that as poems become more independent, the need or sense for a technical guide diminishes. **The increasing difficulty of poems would not necessarily hinder understanding but rather make the reader less separated from poetry by technique**<sup>2</sup>.\n\nRegarding his use of punctuation, the text describes punctuation marks in Cummings' poetry as \"bolts and axels\" that make the poem a \"methodic and fool-proof piece of machinery\" that requires common sense rather than imagination for its operation. **The strong reaction against his typography highlights the difficulty in engaging a reader's common sense as much as their imagination**<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe text concludes by suggesting that while future poems might not all be written \"in the Cummings way,\" his poetry is important as a \"sign of local irritation in the poetic body\" rather than a model for a new tradition. **It emphasizes the need to highlight the differences between good and bad poems to the reading public, especially during a time of popular but superficial education**<sup>4</sup>.",
