# LlamaIndex Integration with Gemini

This example demonstrates how to leverage LlamaIndex alongside Gemini models. LlamaIndex is a versatile data framework that simplifies the process of connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to your custom data sources.

**[Gemini_LlamaIndex_QA_Chroma_WebPageReader.ipynb](./Gemini_LlamaIndex_QA_Chroma_WebPageReader.ipynb)** provides a concrete demonstration of how to build a question answering system.  In this specific example, the notebook utilizes LlamaIndex to ingest and process data from a website, enabling you to ask questions about its content using the power of Gemini.

This example offers a glimpse into how LlamaIndex streamlines the process of integrating external knowledge into LLM applications, opening up a wide range of possibilities for building intelligent systems.
