            "1.  **Rip Currents:** These are strong, narrow currents moving away from the shore, which can pull even strong swimmers out to sea.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** If caught in a rip current, don't panic. Don't try to swim directly against it. Instead, swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, then swim back to shore. If you can't swim to shore, face the shore, wave your arms, and yell for help.\n",
            "2.  **Sun Exposure:** The California sun can be intense, even on cloudy days.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** Apply high SPF sunscreen frequently, wear a hat and sunglasses, and seek shade during the peak sun hours (usually 10 AM to 4 PM). Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n",
            "3.  **Marine Life:** While generally not a major threat, it's good to be aware.\n",
            "    *   **Stingrays:** Shuffle your feet when entering shallow water to scare away stingrays buried in the sand. This is known as the \"stingray shuffle.\"\n",
            "    *   **Jellyfish:** Can sometimes be present, especially after storms or in certain seasons. Most stings are not dangerous but can be painful.\n",
            "    *   **Sharks:** While extremely rare, San Diego waters do have sharks. Always swim in lifeguard-protected areas. Follow any lifeguard warnings or beach closures.\n",
            "4.  **Ocean Conditions (Waves and Tides):** Waves can be powerful, and tides can change, exposing or submerging rocks.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** Pay attention to lifeguard flags and warnings about surf conditions. Be cautious in large surf. Never turn your back on the ocean.\n",
            "5.  **Beach Crowds:** Especially during peak season or holidays, beaches can get very crowded.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** Keep an eye on your belongings. If you're with children, establish a meeting point in case you get separated.\n",
            "6.  **Cold Water:** Even on hot days, the Pacific Ocean water can be quite chilly, especially outside of late summer/early fall.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** If you plan on being in the water for extended periods, consider wearing a wetsuit. Be aware of hypothermia symptoms if you're sensitive to cold.\n",
            "7.  **Slippery Rocks/Cliffs:** Some beaches have rocky areas or cliffs.\n",
            "    *   **What to do:** Be careful walking on wet rocks, as they can be very slippery. Do not climb on unstable cliffs or bluffs, as they are prone to erosion and collapse.\n",

Allomancers burn specific metals to gain powers (e.g., steel for pushing, iron for pulling), and the rules, limitations, and costs are meticulously detailed and explored throughout the series.\n",
            "2.  **The Black Prism (Lightbringer, #1) by Brent Weeks:** In this series, magic users called \"drafters\" can solidify light into a substance called luxin. Different colors have different properties, and there are clear rules about what each color can do, how much one can draft, and the severe consequences of over-drafting. The system is both colorful and highly logical.\n",
            "3.  **Unsouled (Cradle, #1) by Will Wight:** This series features a unique \"sacred arts\" system where individuals cultivate their internal power (madra) to advance through distinct ranks. The rules for advancement, the types of madra, and the specific techniques characters can learn are very detailed, making it a prime example of a progression fantasy with a clearly defined power system.\n",

            "Since you didn't specify a genre, I'll recommend two excellent horror books for you!\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **\"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson:** A masterful work of psychological horror. It follows a small group of people invited to spend a summer at the notoriously haunted Hill House. Jackson builds an incredible atmosphere of dread and uncertainty, blurring the lines between the supernatural and the characters' own fragile minds. It's a classic for a reason!\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **\"A Head Full of Ghosts\" by Paul Tremblay:** A modern and very clever take on possession stories. The narrative unfolds through the eyes of a woman looking back on her childhood, when her older sister seemingly became possessed, leading to a reality TV show and a chaotic household. It's a gripping story that makes you question everything and delivers some genuinely chilling moments.\n"
