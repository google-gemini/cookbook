A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained.\n",

              "*   **Scaled dot-product attention & self-attention**: The use of this mechanism instead of a Recurrent neural network or Long short-term memory allows for better performance. It relies on Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices that come from the same source itself (i.e., the input sequence / context window), which eliminates the need for RNNs completely, ensuring parallelizability. The formula for scaled dot-product attention is: Attention(Q,K,V) := softmax((Q × K^T)/sqrt(d_k)) × V, where Q, K, V are the query, key, value matrices, and d_k is the dimension of the values.\n",
              "*   **Multi-head attention**: This enhances the self-attention mechanism by introducing multiple parallel attention heads. Each head learns different linear projections of the Q, K, and V matrices, allowing the model to capture different aspects of the relationships between words in the sequence simultaneously. This ensures that input embeddings are updated from a more varied and diverse set of perspectives. The outputs from all heads are concatenated and passed through a final linear transformation.\n",
              "*   **Positional encoding**: Since the Transformer does not rely on the sequence of the text (unlike seq2seq models), it uses sine and cosine wave functions to encode the position of the token into the embedding. These positional encodings are then added to the word embedding at that corresponding position. This method was chosen because it \"may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\"\n",

              "*   **Prevalence:** As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture.\n",
              "*   **Key Mechanism (Attention):** In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads.\n",

              "The transformer is a deep learning architecture, introduced in 2017, that has been widely adopted for training Large Language Models (LLMs). Its core innovation is the multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for parallel processing of text and efficient training compared to earlier recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",

              "1.  **Tokenizers:** Convert input text into numerical representations called tokens.\n",
              "2.  **Embedding Layer:** Converts these tokens into vector representations (token embeddings) and adds **positional encodings** to provide information about the tokens' order in the sequence.\n",
              "3.  **Transformer Layers:** These are stacked and perform repeated transformations on the vector representations to extract linguistic information. Each layer primarily consists of:\n",
              "    *   **Multi-Head Attention:** A mechanism that allows each token to be contextualized by \"mixing\" information from other tokens within the context window. It calculates \"attention weights\" based on learned query, key, and value projections, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input. Multi-head attention allows the model to capture different types of \"relevance\" simultaneously.\n",
              "    *   **Feedforward Network (FFN):** A two-layered multilayer perceptron applied independently to each token's representation for further processing.\n",
              "    *   **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:** These are crucial for stabilizing training and ensuring numerical stability, allowing for the stacking of many layers.\n",
              "4.  **Un-embedding Layer:** Converts the final vector representations back into a probability distribution over the vocabulary to generate output tokens.\n",

These models contain a causally masked self-attention mechanism (preventing attention to future tokens) and a feedforward network, but no encoder or cross-attention.\n",
              "*   **Encoder-only Transformers:** Used for tasks like text embedding and representation learning (e.g., BERT). They process the entire input at once, allowing each token to attend to all other tokens (all-to-all attention).\n",
              "*   **Encoder-decoder Transformers:** While the original architecture, they are still used for LLMs for tasks like machine translation or complex instruction following (e.g., T5 series). They combine an encoder to process input and a decoder to generate output.\n",

Their skeletons are well-adapted for running, and they possess powerful jaws with about 42 teeth. Most dogs have 26 tail vertebrae, and their tails are crucial for communication and balance. Their coats can be double or single, and some breeds are hairless. They have well-developed senses of smell (40 times more receptors than humans), hearing (up to four times greater than humans), and vision (though inferior to humans in acuity, they have dichromatic vision).\n",
              "*   **Behavioral:** Dogs have been selectively bred for desired behaviors, including guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. They are highly social animals, uniquely attuned to human behaviors and capable of understanding and communicating with humans. They display complex social cognition and can learn by inference. Their communication includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, and body posture. Dogs typically reach sexual maturity between six months and one year, and females have estrous cycles semi-annually.\n",
              "*   **Health:** Dogs can be susceptible to various inheritable conditions like hip dysplasia, eye abnormalities, heart conditions, and deafness. Neoplasia (cancer) is a common cause of death. Their median longevity is around 12.7 years, negatively correlated with obesity.\n",

              "*   **Physical:** Cats are small carnivorous mammals, typically averaging 46 cm in body length and 23-25 cm in height, with about 30 cm long tails. Males are generally larger than females. They have a smaller skull and shorter bones than their wild ancestors. Their claws are protractible and retractable, keeping them sharp for hunting and climbing. Cats are digitigrade, walking on their toes, and use a \"pacing\" gait. They have excellent night vision due to a tapetum lucidum and large pupils, but poor color vision. Their acute sense of hearing can detect a broad range of frequencies, and they have a highly developed sense of smell with a Jacobson's organ for sensing pheromones. They have about 470 taste buds and cannot taste sweetness. Whiskers provide information about their surroundings.\n",
              "*   **Behavioral:** Cats are solitary hunters but social species. They are crepuscular predators, most active at dawn and dusk, though house cats can adapt to human schedules. They conserve energy by sleeping extensively, averaging 12-16 hours a day. Their intelligence is evident in their adaptability, observational learning, and problem-solving skills. Communication includes a variety of vocalizations and body language. They have rigorous grooming habits and instinctively bury waste. Adult cats are thought to live in an extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. They mark territories with urine spraying and scent gland rubbing. Cats are known for their love of play, which mimics hunting. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant.\n",
              "*   **Health:** About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats. Neutering can increase life expectancy and confer health benefits but can also lead to obesity. The average lifespan of pet cats has risen to about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023.\n",

              "*   **Cognition:** Dogs have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than cats, but studies suggest both have similar cognitive abilities to horses and chimpanzees.\n",
              "*   **Diet:** Dogs are typically described as omnivores and have adapted to starch-rich diets, while cats are obligate carnivores with specific amino acid requirements.\n",
              "*   **Breeding:** Dog breeding has focused on specific tasks and exaggerated features, leading to greater phenotypic diversity. Cat breeding, which began later, emphasizes aesthetic differences, with fewer genetically distinct breeds."

              "*   They have well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.\n",
              "*   Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity.\n",
              "*   Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste).\n",
              "*   They mark their territories by urinating on them.\n",
              "*   Dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior, including being able to understand and communicate with humans.\n",
              "*   They are domesticated members of the family Canidae.\n",
              "*   Dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago.\n",
              "*   They display phenotypic diversity in skull, body, and limb proportions, more than within the entire order of carnivores.\n",
              "*   Dog breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour.\n",
              "*   Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection.\n",
              "*   Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression.\n",
              "*   Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in).\n",
              "*   All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same amount of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.\n",
              "*   The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running.\n",
              "*   The vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to connect to.\n",
              "*   The long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs.\n",
              "*   Their shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility.\n",
              "*   Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.\n",
              "*   The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types (dolichocephalic, mesocephalic/mesaticephalic, brachycephalic).\n",
              "*   The jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh.\n",
              "*   Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized chunks.\n",
              "*   Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception.\n",
              "*   One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.\n",
              "*   Dogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays.\n",
              "*   They have difficulty differentiating between red and green.\n",
              "*   The dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells.\n",
              "*   The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed.\n",
              "*   A study found that dogs' visual acuity was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than a human.\n",
              "*   The dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex.\n",
              "*   Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds.\n",
              "*   This sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species.\n",
              "*   Dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans.\n",
              "*   They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft).\n",
              "*   Dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions.\n",
              "*   The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" (coarse guard hair and soft down hair) or \"single\" (topcoat only).\n",
              "*   Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.\n",
              "*   Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.\n",
              "*   Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat.\n",
              "*   A dog's dewclaw is the fifth digit in its forelimb and hind legs.\n",
              "*   Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin.\n",
              "*   Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs.\n",
              "*   Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges.\n",
              "*   A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin.\n",
              "*   One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state.\n",
              "*   The tail also helps the dog maintain balance.\n",
              "*   It can also help the dog spread its anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement.\n",
              "*   Dogs can have a violet gland (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent.\n",
              "*   Dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli.\n",
              "*   Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail.\n",
              "*   Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail.\n",
              "*   Numerous disorders have been known to affect dogs.\n",
              "*   Dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract diseases, lower respiratory tract diseases, heart diseases, haemopoietic diseases, gastrointestinal disease, hepatic disease, pancreatic disease, renal disease, lower urinary tract disease, endocrine disorders, nervous system diseases, musculoskeletal disease, dermatological disorders, and ophthalmological diseases.\n",
              "*   Common dog parasites are lice, fleas, fly larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and coccidia.\n",

              "*   Other common causes of death are heart and renal failure.\n",
              "*   The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity is approximately 12.7 years.\n",
              "*   Obesity correlates negatively with longevity.\n",
              "*   In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females.\n",
              "*   Female dogs will have their first estrous cycle, characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges, usually lasting between 4 and 20 days.\n",
              "*   They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually.\n",
              "*   Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days.\n",
              "*   An average litter consists of about six puppies.\n",
              "*   Dog behavior has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans.\n",
              "*   They have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.\n",
              "*   Dogs have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than what cats have.\n",
              "*   Compared to their wolf counterparts, dogs tend to be less timid and less aggressive, though some of these genes have been associated with aggression in certain dog breeds.\n",
              "*   Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans.\n",
              "*   A dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable.\n",
              "*   Acute stress reactions from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can evolve into chronic stress.\n",
              "*   Dogs have a natural instinct called prey drive.\n",
              "*   These instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals to be prey or drive possessive behavior.\n",
              "*   Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy.\n",
              "*   Most dogs can swim.\n",
              "*   The female dog may produce colostrum, a type of milk high in nutrients and antibodies, 1–7 days before giving birth.\n",
              "*   Milk production lasts for around three months, and increases with litter size.\n",
              "*   The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions.\n",
              "*   In the later stages of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may occur.\n",
              "*   Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth.\n",
              "*   Dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies.\n",
              "*   Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems.\n",
              "*   Studies suggest that dogs can learn by inference.\n",
              "*   One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of horses, chimpanzees, or cats.\n",
              "*   Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.\n",
              "*   Dog communication is the transfer of information between dogs, as well as between dogs and humans.\n",
              "*   Both sexes of dogs may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing situations.\n",
              "*   Aroused dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher cortisol levels.\n",
              "*   Dogs begin socializing with other dogs by the time they reach the ages of 3 to 8 weeks.\n",
              "*   At about 5 to 12 weeks of age, they alter their focus from dogs to humans.\n",
              "*   Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a bite or to seek comfort.\n",
              "*   With their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive barking patterns that convey different messages.\n",
              "*   Dogs are typically described as omnivores.\n",
              "*   Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.\n",
              "*   Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high-starch diet.\n",
              "*   Despite being an omnivore, dogs are only able to conjugate bile acid with taurine.\n",
              "*   They must get vitamin D from their diet.\n",
              "*   Dogs cannot synthesize ten amino acids: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.\n",
              "*   Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance.\n",
              "*   These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.\n",
              "*   The domesticated dog originated as a predator and scavenger.\n",
              "*   They inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors.\n",
              "*   These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for dogs' trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations.\n",

              "    *   Rigorous grooming habits and instinct to bury their bodily waste make them generally much less messy than other domesticated animals.\n",
              "    *   Development of cat breeds started in the mid-19th century.\n",
              "    *   Genetic diversity of purebred populations is lowest and shows more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.\n",
              "    *   Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.\n",
              "    *   Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but they can range a radius of many hundreds of meters.\n",
              "    *   They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres).\n",

              "    *   Daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 to 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours.\n",
              "    *   \"Cat nap\" refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period.\n",
              "    *   Short periods of rapid eye movement sleep are often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.\n",
              "    *   Behavioral and personality traits depend on a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.\n",
              "    *   Social behavior ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females.\n",
              "    *   Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others.\n",
              "    *   Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories (about 10 times larger than females', overlapping several females' territories).\n",
              "    *   Territories are marked by urine spraying, rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.\n",
              "    *   Between territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts.\n",
              "    *   Outside neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, by staring, hissing, growling, and short, violent, noisy attacks.\n",
              "    *   Do not have a social survival strategy or herd behavior; they always hunt alone.\n",
              "    *   Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation.\n",
              "    *   May express great affection toward humans or other animals.\n",
              "    *   Ethologically, a cat's human keeper functions as a mother surrogate.\n",
              "    *   Adult cats live in a type of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny.\n",
              "    *   High-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant.\n",
              "    *   Some pet cats are poorly socialized.\n",

              "    *   Redirected aggression is common in multiple cat households.\n",
              "    *   Scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means of social bonding.\n",
              "    *   Spend considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.\n",
              "    *   Cats are known for their love of play, especially young kittens.\n",
              "    *   Play mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey.\n",
              "    *   Engage in play fighting, both with each other and with humans.\n",
              "    *   Prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest.\n",
              "    *   Become habituated to a toy they have played with before.\n",
              "    *   Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward into their mouths.\n",

              "    *   Select food based on its temperature, smell, and texture; dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids.\n",
              "    *   Reject novel flavors (neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid unpleasant-tasting foods.\n",
              "    *   Tend to avoid sweet food and milk.\n",
              "    *   Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea.\n",
              "    *   Some develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things such as wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal (pica).\n",
              "    *   Hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents.\n",

              "    *   Other common small creatures, such as lizards and snakes, may also become prey.\n",
              "    *   Use two hunting strategies: stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush.\n",
              "    *   Strategy used depends on available prey (ambush for burrows, active stalking for birds).\n",
              "    *   Domestic males are more likely to fight than females.\n",
              "    *   Most common reason for feral cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female.\n",
              "    *   Most fights are won by the heavier male.\n",
              "    *   Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is difficulty establishing territories within a small home.\n",
              "    *   Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens.\n",
              "    *   Neutering decreases or eliminates fighting behavior in many cases.\n",
              "    *   When aggressive, they try to appear larger and more threatening by raising fur, arching backs, turning sideways, hissing, or spitting.\n",
              "    *   Often, ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage and listen for changes behind them.\n",
              "    *   May vocalize loudly and bare teeth to intimidate opponents.\n",
              "    *   Fights usually consist of grappling, slapping the face and body with forepaws, and bites.\n",
              "    *   Throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake opponent's belly with hind legs.\n",
              "    *   Serious damage is rare, as fights are usually short with the loser fleeing with scratches.\n",
              "    *   More severe fights for mating rights may give deep punctures and lacerations.\n",
              "    *   Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections from scratches and bites.\n",
              "    *   Bites are probably the main route of transmission of the feline immunodeficiency virus.\n",
              "    *   Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights and have battered faces.\n",
              "    *   Are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and foxes.\n",
              "    *   Secrete and perceive pheromones.\n",
              "    *   Female cats (queens) are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, usually lasting 21 days.\n",
              "    *   Usually ready to mate between early February and August in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions.\n",
              "    *   Several males (tomcats) are attracted to a female in heat; they fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate.\n",
              "    *   Female rejects the male at first, but eventually allows mating.\n",
              "    *   Female utters a loud yowl as male pulls out because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines (about 1 mm long), which upon withdrawal may provide increased sexual stimulation to induce ovulation.\n",
              "    *   After mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly.\n",
              "    *   If a male attempts to mate at this point, the female attacks him.\n",
              "    *   After about 20 to 30 minutes of grooming, the cycle repeats.\n",
              "    *   Ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating.\n",
              "    *   Females may not be impregnated by the first male.\n",
              "    *   Cats are superfecund; a female may mate with more than one male when in heat, resulting in different kittens in a litter having different fathers.\n",
              "    *   Morula forms 124 hours after conception.\n",
              "    *   At 148 hours, early blastocysts form.\n",
              "    *   At 10–12 days, implantation occurs.\n",
              "    *   Gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.\n",
              "    *   Have one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens (from a study).\n",
              "    *   Produce a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year.\n",
              "    *   Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age.\n",
              "    *   Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months (varies by breed).\n",
              "    *   Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.\n",
              "    *   Are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age.\n",
              "    *   Can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction.\n",
              "    *   Sterilization prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males, and yowling (calling) in females.\n",
              "    *   Average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades (about 7 years in early 1980s, rising to 9.4 years in 1995, and about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023).\n",
              "    *   Neutering increases life expectancy (castrated males live twice as long as intact males; spayed females live 62% longer than intact females).\n",
              "    *   Neutering confers health benefits, such as decreased incidence of reproductive neoplasia.\n",
              "    *   Neutering decreases metabolism and increases food intake, which can cause obesity.\n",
              "    *   About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats.\n",

              "**Characteristics of Maine Coon Cats:**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Size**: The Maine Coon is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the largest domesticated cats. The Maine Coon is commonly referred to as \"the gentle giant.\" It was considered the largest breed of domestic cat until the introduction of the Savannah cat in the mid-1980s, yet it is still the largest non-hybrid breed. On average, males weigh from 18 to 22 lb (8.2 to 10.0 kg), with females weighing from 12 to 15 lb (5.4 to 6.8 kg). The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16 in (25 and 41 cm) and they can reach a length of up to 38 in (97 cm), including the tail. Their full size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old. Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.\n",
              "*   **Coat**: The Maine Coon is predominantly known for its dense coat of fur which helps it survive in the harsh climate of Maine. It is a long- or medium-haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head and shoulders and longer on the stomach and flanks, with some cats having a leonine ruff around their neck. Their double coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice.\n",
              "*   **Tail**: Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow. It can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a frozen surface. The tail can reach a length of 14 in (36 cm) and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's tail.\n",
              "*   **Paws**: Large paws facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight.\n",
              "*   **Ears**: Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside can keep warm more easily.\n",
              "*   **Body Build**: They have a distinctive physical appearance. The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their weight, and the chest is broad. Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape.\n",
              "*   **Social/Temperament**: The Maine Coon is a social cat. The Maine Coon is often cited as having \"dog-like\" characteristics.\n",
              "*   **Skills**: They possess valuable hunting skills.\n",
              "*   **Coat Colors**: Maine Coons can have any colors that other cats have. The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby.\n",
              "*   **Eye Colors**: All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of blue or odd-eyes (heterochromia iridium) in cats possessing coat colors other than white.\n",
              "*   **Polydactylism**: Many of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on a paw). Polydactyly not only affects digit number and conformation, but also carpus and tarsus conformation.\n",
              "*   **Life Expectancy**: Pet insurance data from Sweden (2003–2006) puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at > 12.5 years. A UK study found a life expectancy of 9.71 years.\n",
              "*   **Health Concerns**:\n",
              "    *   **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: A mutation in the MYBPC3 gene found in Maine Coons has been associated with HCM. Approximately one-third tested positive for the mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at Washington State University. Not all cats that test positive will have clinical signs of the disease, and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, suggesting a second mutation exists. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1%.\n",
              "    *   **Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)**: Renal cysts are observed with a low incidence in Maine Coons. In a 2013 study, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons. These cysts were mostly single and unilateral (85.7%), small (mean 3.6 mm in diameter), and located at the corticomedullary junction. All six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts tested negative for the PKD1 mutation. 'Maine Coon PKD' represents a form of juvenile nephropathy other than PKD.\n",
              "    *   **Hip dysplasia**: An abnormality of the hip joint which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. Maine Coons are one of the breeds commonly affected. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (1974-2011) indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic.\n",
              "    *   **Spinal muscular atrophy**: The Maine Coon is one of the more commonly affected breeds for spinal muscular atrophy. An autosomal recessive mutation in both the LIX1 and LNPEP gene are responsible for the condition in the breed.\n",
              "    *   **Entropion**: Maine Coons also seem to be predisposed to develop entropion, mainly on the lateral aspect of the eyelids, which can lead to corneal irritation and ulceration, and may require surgery.\n",

A survey found 59% of Akitas displayed aggression towards other dogs and animals, and 13% displayed aggression towards humans. Human-directed aggression often involves a visitor on the Akita's territory, highlighting its defensive nature. Stereotypic behavior was reported in 27% of Akitas. Excessive vocalization was reported at 17%. Less than 10% reported separation anxiety.

              "*   **Physical:** Dogs are incredibly diverse in shape, size, and color, with around 450 globally recognized breeds. They range from tiny Chihuahuas to massive Great Danes. Their skeletons are well-adapted for running, and they possess powerful jaws with about 42 teeth. Most dogs have 26 tail vertebrae, and their tails are crucial for communication and balance. Their coats can be double or single, and some breeds are hairless. They have well-developed senses of smell (40 times more receptors than humans), hearing (up to four times greater than humans), and vision (though inferior to humans in acuity, they have dichromatic vision).\n",
              "*   **Behavioral:** Dogs have been selectively bred for desired behaviors, including guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. They are highly social animals, uniquely attuned to human behaviors and capable of understanding and communicating with humans. They display complex social cognition and can learn by inference. Their communication includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, and body posture. Dogs typically reach sexual maturity between six months and one year, and females have estrous cycles semi-annually.\n",
              "*   **Health:** Dogs can be susceptible to various inheritable conditions like hip dysplasia, eye abnormalities, heart conditions, and deafness. Neoplasia (cancer) is a common cause of death. Their median longevity is around 12.7 years, negatively correlated with obesity.\n",

Males are generally larger than females. They have a smaller skull and shorter bones than their wild ancestors. Their claws are protractible and retractable, keeping them sharp for hunting and climbing. Cats are digitigrade, walking on their toes, and use a \"pacing\" gait. They have excellent night vision due to a tapetum lucidum and large pupils, but poor color vision. Their acute sense of hearing can detect a broad range of frequencies, and they have a highly developed sense of smell with a Jacobson's organ for sensing pheromones. They have about 470 taste buds and cannot taste sweetness. Whiskers provide information about their surroundings.\n",
              "*   **Behavioral:** Cats are solitary hunters but social species. They are crepuscular predators, most active at dawn and dusk, though house cats can adapt to human schedules. They conserve energy by sleeping extensively, averaging 12-16 hours a day. Their intelligence is evident in their adaptability, observational learning, and problem-solving skills. Communication includes a variety of vocalizations and body language. They have rigorous grooming habits and instinctively bury waste. Adult cats are thought to live in an extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. They mark territories with urine spraying and scent gland rubbing. Cats are known for their love of play, which mimics hunting. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant.\n",
              "*   **Health:** About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats. Neutering can increase life expectancy and confer health benefits but can also lead to obesity. The average lifespan of pet cats has risen to about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023.\n",

              "Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.\n",
              "The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.\n",
              "Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.\n",
              "Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\n",
              "Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.\n",
              "They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.\n",
              "Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity.\n",
              "Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.\n",
              "Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste).\n",
              "They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment.\n",
              "Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans.\n",
              "As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man's best friend\".\n",
              "The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world.\n",
              "The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households.\n",
              "Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.\n",
              "Dogs are domesticated members of the family Canidae.\n",
              "They are classified as a subspecies of Canis lupus, along with wolves and dingoes.\n",
              "Dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, before the development of agriculture.\n",
              "The remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be conclusively identified as a domesticated dog.\n",
              "Genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n",
              "The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.\n",
              "Dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species.\n",
              "In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for \"dog\") to the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae.\n",
              "He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris.\n",
              "Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other canid.\n",
              "In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793.\n",
              "Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo.\n",
              "The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany.\n",
              "Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.\n",
              "The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks.\n",
              "The dog had died of canine distemper.\n",
              "This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of hunter-gatherers, which predates agriculture.\n",
              "DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any modern wolf lineage.\n",
              "The dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps).\n",
              "In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia, with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.\n",
              "In 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves.\n",
              "As the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation.\n",
              "These genes are linked to neural crest and central nervous system development.\n",
              "These genes affect embryogenesis and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome.\n",
              "The study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior.\n",
              "This trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs.\n",
              "There are around 450 official dog breeds, the most of any mammal.\n",
              "Dogs began diversifying in the Victorian era, when humans took control of their natural selection.\n",
              "Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years.\n",
              "Since then, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been subjected to artificial selection by humans.\n",
              "The skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores.\n",
              "These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour.\n",
              "As such, humans have long used dogs for their desirable traits to complete or fulfill a certain work or role.\n",
              "Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection.\n",
              "Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression.\n",
              "Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world.\n",
              "Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in).\n",
              "All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same amount of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.\n",
              "The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility.\n",
              "Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers.\n",
              "Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.\n",
              "The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types.\n",
              "The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.\n",
              "The jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh.\n",
              "Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat.\n",
              "Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception.\n",
              "One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.\n",
              "Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm magnetic field conditions.\n",
              "Dogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays.\n",
              "They have difficulty differentiating between red and green, and much like other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells compared to the human's three.\n",
              "The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have different retina configurations.\n",
              "The fovea centralis area of the eye is attached to a nerve fiber, and is the most sensitive to photons.\n",
              "Additionally, a study found that dogs' visual acuity was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than a human.\n",
              "While the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex.\n",
              "Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds.\n",
              "This sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc.\n",
              "Dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans.\n",
              "They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.\n",
              "Dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions.\n",
              "The lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw.\n",
              "Whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth.\n",
              "The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only.\n",
              "Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.\n",
              "Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.\n",
              "Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat.\n",
              "A dog's dewclaw is the fifth digit in its forelimb and hind legs.\n",
              "Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin.\n",
              "Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs.\n",
              "Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges.\n",
              "A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles.\n",
              "One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state.\n",
              "The tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement.\n",
              "Dogs can have a violet gland (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent.\n",
              "A study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli.\n",
              "Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail.\n",
              "In some hunting dogs, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.\n",
              "Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail.\n",
              "Numerous disorders have been known to affect dogs.\n",
              "Some are congenital and others are acquired.\n",
              "Dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract diseases including diseases that affect the nasal cavity, the larynx, and the trachea; lower respiratory tract diseases which includes pulmonary disease and acute respiratory diseases; heart diseases which includes any cardiovascular inflammation or dysfunction of the heart; haemopoietic diseases including anaemia and clotting disorders; gastrointestinal disease such as diarrhoea and gastric dilatation volvulus; hepatic disease such as portosystemic shunts and liver failure; pancreatic disease such as pancreatitis; renal disease; lower urinary tract disease such as cystitis and urolithiasis; endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Cushing's syndrome, hypoadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism; nervous system diseases such as seizures and spinal injury; musculoskeletal disease such as arthritis and myopathies; dermatological disorders such as alopecia and pyoderma; ophthalmological diseases such as conjunctivitis, glaucoma, entropion, and progressive retinal atrophy; and neoplasia.\n",
              "Common dog parasites are lice, fleas, fly larvae, ticks, mites, cestodes, nematodes, and coccidia.\n",
              "Taenia is a notable genus with 5 species in which dogs are the definitive host.\n",

              "*   Some cats purr continuously when chronically ill or in apparent pain.\n",
              "*   Purring is proposed to be generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, causing the vocal folds to separate forcefully.\n",
              "*   The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis are thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30–40 milliseconds (frequency of 33 to 25 Hz).\n",

              "*   Domestic males are more likely to fight than females.\n",
              "*   The most common reason for feral cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female, and most fights are won by the heavier male.\n",

Their hearing is extremely acute, ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, and they can detect ultrasound. They have an acute sense of smell due to a well-developed olfactory bulb. Cats have about 470 taste buds and cannot taste sweetness.\n",

              "The dingo and the related New Guinea singing dog resulted from the geographic isolation and feralization of dogs in Oceania over 8,000 years ago.\n",
              "Dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species.\n",
              "In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus assigned the genus name Canis (which is the Latin word for \"dog\") to the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal in his book, Systema Naturae.\n",
              "He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris.\n",
              "Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata in Latin term), which is not found in any other canid.\n",
              "In the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of Canis lupus and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo, named by Meyer in 1793.\n",
              "Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo.\n",
              "The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany.\n",
              "Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.\n",
              "The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks.\n",
              "The dog had died of canine distemper.\n",
              "This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of hunter-gatherers, which predates agriculture.\n",
              "DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any modern wolf lineage.\n",
              "The dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps).\n",
              "In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia, with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.\n",
              "In 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves.\n",
              "As the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation.\n",
              "These genes are linked to neural crest and central nervous system development.\n",
              "These genes affect embryogenesis and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome.\n",
              "The study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior.\n",
              "This trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs.\n",
              "There are around 450 official dog breeds, the most of any mammal.\n",
              "Dogs began diversifying in the Victorian era, when humans took control of their natural selection.\n",
              "Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years.\n",
              "Since then, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been subjected to artificial selection by humans.\n",
              "The skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores.\n",
              "These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour.\n",
              "As such, humans have long used dogs for their desirable traits to complete or fulfill a certain work or role.\n",
              "Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, retrieving, and scent detection.\n",
              "Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression.\n",
              "Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world.\n",
              "Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in).\n",
              "All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same amount of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.\n",
              "The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility.\n",
              "Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers.\n",
              "Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.\n",
              "The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types.\n",
              "The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.\n",
              "The jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh.\n",
              "Dogs use their carnassial teeth to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat.\n",
              "Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception.\n",
              "One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.\n",
              "Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm magnetic field conditions.\n",
              "Dogs' vision is dichromatic; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays.\n",
              "They have difficulty differentiating between red and green, and much like other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells compared to the human's three.\n",
              "The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have different retina configurations.\n",
              "The fovea centralis area of the eye is attached to a nerve fiber, and is the most sensitive to photons.\n",
              "Additionally, a study found that dogs' visual acuity was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of brightness was about two times worse than a human.\n",
              "While the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by a large olfactory cortex.\n",
              "Dogs have roughly forty times more smell-sensitive receptors than humans, ranging from about 125 million to nearly 300 million in some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds.\n",
              "This sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc.\n",
              "Dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans.\n",
              "They can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans.\n",
              "Dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as whiskers that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions.\n",
              "The lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw.\n",
              "Whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth.\n",
              "The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only.\n",
              "Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.\n",
              "Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.\n",
              "Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat.\n",
              "A dog's dewclaw is the fifth digit in its forelimb and hind legs.\n",
              "Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin.\n",
              "Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs.\n",
              "Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges.\n",
              "A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column, which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles.\n",
              "One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state.\n",
              "The tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its anal gland's scent through the tail's position and movement.\n",
              "Dogs can have a violet gland (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent.\n",
              "A study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli.\n",
              "Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail.\n",
              "In some hunting dogs, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.\n",
              "Some dogs can be born without tails because of a DNA variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail.\n",

              "Genes found in humans to be responsible for disorders are investigated in dogs as being the cause and vice versa.\n",
              "The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years.\n",
              "Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs to have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.\n",
              "In a 2024 UK study analyzing 584,734 dogs, it was concluded that purebred dogs lived longer than crossbred dogs, challenging the previous notion of the latter having the higher life expectancies.\n",

              "In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds.\n",
              "This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle, characterized by their vulvas swelling and producing discharges, usually lasting between 4 and 20 days.\n",
              "They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy.\n",
              "At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation.\n",
              "Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.\n",
              "Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation.\n",
              "After ejaculation, the dogs are coitally tied for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's bulbus glandis swelling and the female's constrictor vestibuli contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to muscle relaxation.\n",
              "14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.\n",
              "Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary.\n",
