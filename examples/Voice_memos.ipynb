            "## The Power of \"Write to Think\": Reframing Throwaway Work\n",
            "\n",
            "Early in my career, I spent countless hours crafting visions, roadmaps, and innovative ideas. I remember the frustration of entire projects being scrapped, deemed no longer relevant. It felt like a monumental waste of time. If you’re anything like me, you came straight out of school thinking “here’s the content that is needed, now produce it” - so the professional world felt shockingly different when entering the workforce. Priorities shift, markets change, and sometimes, despite the best efforts, projects get shelved.\n",
            "\n",
            "This still happens to me and my teams today.\n",
            "\n",
            "For a long time, I struggled to reconcile this reality with my ingrained belief that every task should lead to a tangible outcome. It was difficult to come to terms with the idea that a lot of the work you put in at the end of the day, might not matter, might not be used, might not go anywhere.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, I joined my current team, where the \"right to think\" is deeply ingrained in our culture. This seemingly simple concept completely changed my perspective. It’s more than just accepting that priorities change, and work sometimes gets abandoned. It's about recognizing that **the act of creating content, regardless of its final destination, is an integral part of the learning process.**\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Write to think\" means embracing the idea that the content you produce is a tool for honing your skills and sharpening your understanding. It's about writing more, writing earlier, and writing often, not necessarily with the expectation of a polished final product. It's about being willing to scrap an idea once it has served its purpose – to clarify your thinking and push you forward.\n",
            "\n",
            "This approach ties in beautifully with iterative processes and learning by doing. But it also offers a powerful new frame on what used to be considered “throwaway work.”\n",
            "\n",
            "### Shifting the Mindset: From Waste to Investment\n",
            "\n",
            "In the \"write to think\" model, there's no such thing as wasted effort. Every piece of content, every discarded draft, contributes to your growth. It’s all helping you hone your skills and get better over time. It's an investment in your future capabilities, particularly when it comes to ideation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The question then becomes: how can we extend this mindset to all aspects of our work? How can we accelerate the learning and growth that comes from the \"write to think\" approach?\n",
            "\n",
            "The answer, I believe, lies in consciously embracing the practice of writing more:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Write more:** Generate a higher volume of content, exploring different angles and approaches.\n",
            "*   **Write earlier:** Start writing at the beginning of a project, even when your ideas are still nebulous.\n",
            "*   **Write often:** Make writing a regular habit, a tool for continuous learning and refinement.\n",
            "*   **Write without attachment:** Be willing to abandon ideas that don't resonate, focusing on the insights gained along the way.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Write to think\" is about recognizing that the value lies not just in the finished product, but in the journey of creation itself. It's a powerful tool for unlocking creativity, accelerating learning, and ultimately becoming a more effective professional. It's about reframing \"throwaway work\" as an essential part of the process, helping you to hone your skills and get better over time. Young Jaclyn would be proud.\n",
