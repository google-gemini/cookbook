# Gemini API and Google Workspace Codelab

These are the final, accompanying files for the [Automate Google Workspace tasks with the Gemini API
](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-workspace) codelab. This codelabs shows you how to
connect to the Gemini API using Apps Script, and uses the function calling, vision and text capabilities to automate
Google Workspace tasks - summarising a document, analyzing a chart, sending an email and generating some slides directly. All of this is done from a free text input.

Please read and follow along with the main codelab, and if you get stuck you can load these files directly.

This workshop was featured at [Google I/O 2024](https://io.google/2024/).
