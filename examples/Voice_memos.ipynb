            "Stepping into the professional world, particularly in product development, felt wildly different. I spent a significant amount of time working on visions, roadmaps, and intricate ideas – projects that felt substantial and important at the time. But, as priorities shifted, markets changed, or new information emerged (all perfectly valid reasons, by the way), many of these projects ended up not happening at all.

            "2.  **Detach from Finality:** Write *without* the immediate pressure or expectation that this needs to be a polished, final product. The goal isn't necessarily to ship *this specific document*, but to use the act of creating it to refine your thinking.\n",
            "3.  **Be Willing to Scrap:** Understand that once the writing has served its primary purpose – helping you clarify your thoughts, explore options, or learn something new – you might be willing to discard the artifact itself. It hasn't been a waste; it has been a tool for learning.\n",
