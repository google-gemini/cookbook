The socio-economic ramifications of post-industrial capitalism have been a subject of extensive debate among scholars. This essay delineates the primary arguments, focusing on the dichotomy between neoliberal proponents and their Marxist critics. The former argue for market-led growth, citing empirical evidence of poverty reduction, while the latter highlight the exacerbation of inequality and labor exploitation. Ultimately, a synthesis of these perspectives suggests that while globalization has generated unprecedented wealth, its distribution remains fundamentally inequitable, necessitating robust state intervention.

**Key Concepts:**
-   **Supply and Demand:** As price increases, supply increases and demand decreases. Equilibrium is where they intersect.
-   **Elasticity:** Measures sensitivity of demand/supply to price changes.
-   **Opportunity Cost:** The value of the next-best alternative forgone.

**Potential Questions:**
1.  Explain the concept of market equilibrium.
2.  What are the determinants of price elasticity of demand?
