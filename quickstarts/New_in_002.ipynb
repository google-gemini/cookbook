The energy and resources used to maintain a tail became a disadvantage, so individuals with smaller tails or no tails had a slight evolutionary advantage.  Natural selection favored individuals with mutations that progressively reduced tail size.\\n\\n* **Developmental changes:** Changes in the genes controlling embryonic development led to the shortening of the tail during human development. The tail's reduction may have been a consequence of changes in other aspects of our anatomy and development, such as changes to the spine and pelvis related to bipedalism.\\n\\n* **Genetic mutations:** Random genetic mutations that affected tail development could have spread through the population if they conferred even a slight advantage or were neutral in their effect.\\n\\nEssentially, the tail became a vestigial structure \\u2013 a feature that has lost most or all of its original function through evolution.  While we don't have external tails, we do retain a vestigial tailbone (coccyx) at the base of our spine, which is evidence of our tailed ancestry.\\n\"\n",
