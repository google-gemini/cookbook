              "'Oliver was the kind of boy who prepared for everything, yet felt ready for nothing. He carried a spare umbrella on cloudless days, three different types of pens in case two failed, and a map of a town he had lived in his entire life.\\n\\nBut everything changed the day he found the Rucksack of Requirement at a dusty garage sale for three dollars.\\n\\nIt was a faded, forest-green canvas bag with brass buckles that looked like squinting eyes. The seller, an old woman with wind-chimes in her hair, had whispered, \"Be careful, dear. It doesn’t give you what you want. It gives you what you need.\"\\n\\nOliver didn\\'t believe in magic, but he did believe in a bargain. He took it home, emptied his old nylon bag, and began to pack.\\n\\nThe first sign that something was wrong happened the next morning on his way to school. Oliver reached into the bag for his history textbook. Instead, his fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He pulled it out. \\n\\nIt was a heavy, Victorian-style brass key.\\n\\n\"That’s not right,\" Oliver muttered. He reached in again. This time, he pulled out a sandwich wrapped in wax paper. He already had a sandwich in his lunchbox. He reached in a third time and found a coil of thin, shimmering silver wire.\\n\\nBy the time he got to school, Oliver was frustrated. He had no textbook, no notebook, and a pocket full of junk. \\n\\nDuring lunch, he sat by the old oak tree at the edge of the playground. He saw Maya, a girl from his class, sitting on a bench, looking distraught. She was patting her pockets frantically.\\n\\n\"I lost it,\" she sobbed as Oliver approached. \"The key to the violin storage room. My recital is in twenty minutes, and the teacher left for lunch with the spare!\"\\n\\nOliver froze. He reached into his side pocket and felt the cold brass. \"Is it… looks like this?\"\\n\\nMaya’s eyes went wide. \"How did you—? Yes! That’s it! Where did you find it?\"\\n\\n\"I... just found it,\" Oliver said, stunned. \\n\\nAs Maya ran off, shouting her thanks, Oliver looked down at the green backpack. It seemed to puff out its chest, the brass buckles glinting in the sun.\\n\\nThe afternoon brought more strangeness. On his walk home, he took a shortcut through the park and found a stray dog whose leash had snapped. The dog was shivering, trapped on a small island in the middle of the decorative pond, too scared to swim back. Oliver reached into his bag for his phone to call animal control. \\n\\nInstead, he pulled out the shimmering silver wire. \\n\\nHe realized it wasn\\'t wire at all—it was an unbreakable, lightweight cord. He tied it to his belt, waded out just far enough to reach the dog, and used the cord as a makeshift lead to guide the frightened pup back to safety.\\n\\nBy the time Oliver reached his front door, he realized he had stopped checking his map. He had stopped worrying about his spare pens. The bag felt lighter than it had in the morning, despite the strange items inside.\\n\\nThat evening, a storm rolled in—a sudden, violent summer gale. The power in Oliver\\'s house flickered and died. His father groaned from the kitchen. \"I can’t find the flashlight, and I need to check the fuse box in the basement. Oliver, do you have your emergency kit?\"\\n\\nOliver grabbed the green rucksack. He didn\\'t even look inside. He just reached in, trusting. \\n\\nHe didn\\'t pull out a flashlight. He pulled out a small, glass jar filled with what looked like trapped starlight. It pulsed with a soft, rhythmic blue glow that illuminated the entire hallway.\\n\\n\"Whoa,\" his dad whispered. \"Where did you get that?\"\\n\\n\"It was just… in the bag,\" Oliver said, smiling.\\n\\nThat night, as the rain lashed against his window, Oliver looked at the rucksack sitting at the foot of his bed. He realized that for the first time in his life, he wasn\\'t worried about tomorrow. \\n\\nHe didn\\'t need to pack for every disaster. He didn\\'t need to plan every step. The bag didn\\'t just hold objects; it held a lesson. Life was unpredictable, yes, but it also provided the tools to handle the chaos, often in the most unexpected ways.\\n\\nHe reached into the bag one last time before sleep, wondering what he might \"need\" for a restful night.\\n\\nHe pulled out a small, dried sprig of lavender and a book of poetry he’d never seen before. \\n\\nOliver sighed, leaned back against his pillow, and began to read by the light of the jar of stars. He was exactly where he needed to be.'"

              "The class was supposed to stay on the marked trail, but a sudden, blinding snowsquall turned the world white in seconds. In the confusion, Oliver and Maya became separated from the group. The wind howled, erasing their footprints. \n",

              "He opened the brass buckles. This time, the bag felt different. It felt heavy, humming with a low, rhythmic vibration, like a cat purring. He reached in. He reached past the spot where his textbooks should be. He reached until his shoulder was pressed against the opening.\n",
              "\n",
              "He pulled out a lantern. But it wasn't a battery-powered one; it was an old iron lantern with a flame that burned a bright, warm violet.\n",

              "\n",
              "A moment later, they heard a sound in the distance—a low, answering bark. Out of the white mist emerged the park ranger’s rescue dog, a massive Saint Bernard, followed closely by the beams of flashlights.\n",

              "\n",
              "Oliver ran a hand over the rough canvas. He thought about the sandwich, the compass, and the bell. He realized that the bag didn't just hold things; it held possibilities. It was a bridge between what was and what could be.\n",
              "\n",
              "\"I don't think it goes anywhere,\" Oliver said, smiling. \"I think it’s just waiting for the next time someone is in trouble.\"\n",

              "That night, Oliver tried to put his pajamas into the bag for a sleepover. The bag resisted, the zipper sticking stubbornly. Then, he realized he didn't need his pajamas yet—he needed to finish his book report. \n",
              "\n",
              "He reached into the side pocket. He didn't find a pen. He found a single, perfect piece of bittersweet chocolate and a bookmark that glowed in the dark.\n",
              "\n",
              "Oliver chuckled, popped the chocolate into his mouth, and got to work. He didn't know where the backpack had come from, or who had owned it before him, but he knew one thing for sure: he would never be truly lost again.\"\"\",\n",
