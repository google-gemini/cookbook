            "Coming straight out of school, I was conditioned to think of work as an assignment: you receive it, you execute, you're graded. There were no do-overs, no changes of heart. This felt wildly different than the workforce. It was difficult to reconcile the idea that I could pour my heart and soul into something, only for it to be deemed irrelevant or unnecessary.\n",
