I laid out the initial clues: Carol owns a dog, the red house owner has a cat, Alice doesn't own a cat, Bob's not in the green house, the green house is left of the red house.\n",

              "The next step was to fit the remaining information. Since Bob's in Red, the clue about him not being in Green was consistent. I was left with Alice, Carol, the Green house, the Blue house, and the \"no-cat-no-dog\" pet.\n",

              "*   **Customized CRISPR Treatment for Genetic Disease:** A significant breakthrough in gene-editing technology occurred with the first-ever customized CRISPR gene-editing therapy administered to a baby in the U.S. to fix a specific mutation causing a rare genetic disorder called carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency. This marks a major step forward in personalized medicine using CRISPR technology.\n",
              "*   **Discovery of MoM-z14, the Most Distant Galaxy:** Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers confirmed MoM-z14 as the most distant galaxy ever detected, with its formation occurring within 280 million years of the Big Bang. This discovery provides unprecedented insights into the early universe.\n",
              "*   **New Earth-Like Exoplanets Discovered:** The NASA James Webb Space Telescope, in conjunction with TESS, identified several Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zones of distant stars. Notably, Gliese 12 b, located 40 light-years away, shows potential for liquid water, significantly advancing the search for extraterrestrial life.\n",
              "*   **Advancements in Artificial Organs Grown in Labs:** Researchers have made progress in bioprinting fully functioning artificial human organs, such as kidneys and livers, using stem cell technology. This holds immense promise for addressing organ shortages and revolutionizing transplant medicine.\n",
              "*   **World Record for Nuclear Fusion Plasma Duration:** The WEST tokamak in France maintained plasma for 1,337 seconds, setting a new world record for nuclear fusion duration and surpassing the previous record by 25%. This is a crucial step toward viable and sustainable fusion energy.\n",
              "*   **First-Ever Gonorrhea Vaccine Launched:** NHS England launched the world's first gonorrhea vaccine, demonstrating an efficacy of 30-40%. This represents a significant public health achievement in combating antibiotic-resistant infections.\n",
              "*   **Discovery of Genes Linked to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** A study involving over 2 million people identified 250 genes linked to OCD, marking the first time genes associated with the condition have been discovered. This breakthrough opens new avenues for understanding and treating OCD.\n",
              "*   **New Evidence of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes:** Scientists discovered new evidence supporting the existence of intermediate-mass black holes. These elusive black holes fill a critical gap in our understanding of black hole formation and evolution.\n",
              "*   **Webb Telescope Refines Hubble Constant:** The Webb telescope provided data that helps refine the Hubble constant, potentially contributing to the resolution of the long-standing debate about the universe's expansion rate. This refinement has profound implications for cosmology.\n",
              "*   **Development of Night-Vision Contact Lenses:** Scientists have created contact lenses that enable \"super-vision,\" allowing individuals to see beyond the visible light range and pick up infrared light even in darkness. This technology could potentially replace traditional night-vision goggles.\n",
              "*   **Sunlight Reactor for Hydrogen Fuel:** A prototype reactor capable of harvesting hydrogen fuel using only sunlight and water has been developed. This advancement is critical for producing \"green hydrogen\" more cost-effectively, moving towards sustainable energy."
